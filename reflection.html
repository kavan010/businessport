      <h1>Course Reflection</h1>
      <p>This page coveres my reflection on the things I've learned in the BEP200 course, going over my best work and the top skills I believe I've learned.</p>
      <p>What I‚Äôm proud of: creating a brand, presenting a pitch, and completing all checkpoints successfully!</p>
      <br/>

      <h2>üåü My Best Work:</h2>
      <img src="assets/teachify.png" alt="Reflection Moment"/>
      <p>My best work was the <strong>Teachify</strong> entrepreneurial venture, where I combined everything I learned into a real business idea and pitch.</p>

      <h2>üèÜ My Favourite Assignment:</h2>
      <p>The <strong>Dragon's Den - Tropix</strong> pitch was my favourite because it was interactive and let us apply our learning to a real-world scenario.</p>

      <h2>üí° 3 Entrepreneurial Skills:</h2>
      <ul class="reflection-list">
        <li><u>Leadership</u> - Guiding teams and making sure everyone works efficiently together.</li>
        <li><u>Organization</u> - Keeping track of multiple tasks and deadlines in a structured way.</li>
        <li><u>Analytical</u> - Breaking down problems and making data-driven decisions.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>üöÄ Entrepreneurial Skill I'm Trying to Learn:</h2>
      <p><u>Project Management</u> - I want to get better at planning, tracking, and executing projects from start to finish.</p>

      <h2>üîÑ Differently in the Course:</h2>
      <p>I would have participated more in group discussions and tried to take on more leadership roles during projects.</p>

      <h2>üîÆ How Entrepreneur Skills will Help me in the Future:</h2>
      <p>These skills will help me adapt, lead, and innovate in any career I choose, especially in fast-changing industries.</p>

      <h2>‚úàÔ∏è Aerospace Engineering using Entrepreneurial Skills:</h2>
      <p>My career of choice, aerospace engineering, often requires many of the entrepreneurial skills that we've learned in this course:</p>
      <ul class="reflection-list">
        <li><u>Leadership</u> - Many aerospace engineers work in small groups on specific tasks on a project. Leadership is essential in managing these small teams to get the most out of every individual. Leadership in this context includes giving all team members the correct roles, managing everyone's work to ensure deadlines are met, bringing all the parts together to create a final product, and overall managing the team to get work done efficiently.</li>
        <li><u>Organization</u> - Organization is vital in aerospace engineering since often in aerospace engineering we are working on many tasks at once with multiple different components that if not organized well can become overwhelming and messy. Organization means using a calendar to organize your time, having organization in the literal sense with all your designs and parts correctly categorized along with working with your team by organizing the overall project to seamlessly flow together.</li>
        <li><u>Analytical</u> - Analytical skills are vital in aerospace engineering as they provide engineers with the ability to analyse the many problems that occur with aircraft. Analytical skills are used when designing airframes to ensure they meet the specified criteria, analysing the different components of the aircraft and the different data to make the most reasonable decisions, and to correctly bring all the data together for effective execution of our plans.</li>
        <li><u>Project Management</u> - As I‚Äôve mentioned before, aerospace engineers often work in small teams on very specific parts of the overall project. Project management is vital to ensuring that the project flows smoothly with the team. Managing a project includes making sure that the task is clearly defined to members, having a clear and concise plan to accomplish the set goal, and tracking progress to ensure the plan is being executed.</li>
        <li><u>Technological Skills</u> - Apart from the practical technical skills needed to develop aircraft, it is important for engineers to be able to use and adapt to different softwares for all sorts of tasks such as design, testing, and team collaboration. It is also vital that engineers are able to use presentation softwares and online tools to represent their work to senior engineers.  Without these technical skills and familiarity with online software engineers may not be able to convey effectively their ideas and work.</li>
