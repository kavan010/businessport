      <h1>Course Reflection</h1>
      <p>This page coveres my reflection on the things I've learned in the BEP200 course, going over my best work and the top skills I believe I've learned.</p>
      <p>What I‚Äôm proud of: analysing many companys and their business models, and learning how to apply these concepts to my own entrepreneurial ideas, presenting my own pitch and using material learned in class to elevate its effectiveness, and learning principles of accounting and understanding the field of accounting better.</p>

      <h2>üåü My Best Work:</h2>
      <img src="assets/teachify.png" alt="Reflection Moment"/>
      <p>My best work thus far in the semester has to be the <strong>Teachify</strong> entrepreneurial venture, where I combined everything I learned into a real business idea and pitched it to the class. Apart from the pitch itself this assignment incorperated everything learned in class and we got to apply all the material in a real world scenario and apply business skills to assess viable oppurtnities in the market.</p>

      <h2>üèÜ My Favourite Assignment:</h2>
      <p>In terms of fun and interesting to work on, the <strong>Accounting Assignments</strong> was particularly interesting for me as prior I had little expertise on how accounting worked however this assignment, along with the lesson explaining the differences between Managerial and Financial accounts, along with the actionable activity of creating our own income and balance sheets and going deep into the formating was definitly a unique experience in teaching students about the world of accounting. </p>

      <h2>üí° 3 Entrepreneurial Skills:</h2>
      <ul class="reflection-list">
        <li><u>Leadership</u> - Throughout the course we learned a lot about leadership and how businesses lead their teams to preform to the highest efficiency. Paralell to this, we learned about management and the different management styles and how different styles of leaders work together to create the most efficient team possible. Additionally whiles working on projects such as the entrepreneurial venture, we were given the oppurtunity to test our leadership and how we woudl organize and lead a business on our own. In addition to activities we did such as the paper house, leadership was a constant theme that I definitly developed throughout the course.</li>
        <li><u>Organization</u> - In this course I definitly improved my organization not only in my assignemnts and my time management, but learning about how organization plays a role in real businesses. We learned about the different aspects of running a business: organizing production with the factors of production and the six primary industries, along with the skill or organizing the marketing behind a business. Along with this we learned the importance of organization in accounting in how strick the formating is on income and balance sheets with underlines and dolar signs. Overall organization was a constant theme evident in this course.</li>
        <li><u>Analytical Thinking</u> - Throughout the course analytical thinking can be observed in almost every unit that we learned. We learned about the immense research that goes into creating viable customer avatars based on demographics, geographics, psychographics, and their buyer behaviour. Analysing the competition, company, and consumer profile has required immense levels of analytical thinking aswell. In terms of production, formating out the production of your product from its fundemental industries to the factors of production that lead to the final product require meticulous plannning and analytical thinking.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>üöÄ Entrepreneurial Skill I'm Trying to Learn:</h2>
      <p><u>Project Management</u> - Within this course and all the skills that I went over, I feel that the one skill I want to improve on is at planning, tracking, and executing projects from start to finish. I feel that my project management and by ability to execute projects could be improved as I often don't incorperate enough creative elements and think very in-the-box which I believe makes some of my work a bit bland. Especially in group projects I believe I often just take all the work and don't collaberate with my peers enough, and I would want to aim to improve this in the future.</p>

      <h2>üîÑ Differently in the Course:</h2>
      <p>One thing that I would want to see more of in the course is leadership oppurtnities and perhaps even mock businesses where we are given practical situations to practice leadership and how we would make decisions to improve it. This would give us more practical experience in managing and making decisions for a practical business. This would also help us review the material learned in an even more practical way and see how it is implemented in how businesses are managed in real life.</p>

      <h2>üîÆ How Entrepreneur Skills will Help me in the Future:</h2>
      <p>In the future I see the many skills that I've learned in this course coming in very handy as I plan to do many things that these skills will assist me in. Firstly my goal to start a startup in the future will require many of the skills learned in this course such as accounting, marketing, analytical thinking, analysing markets and coming up with viable business ideas. Additionally in my possible career of aerospace engineering many of the skills we learn in this course can also come in very handy as detailed below. Overall I see these skills helping me immensely in the near future.</p>

      <h2>‚úàÔ∏è Aerospace Engineering using Entrepreneurial Skills:</h2>
      <p>My career of choice, aerospace engineering, often requires many of the entrepreneurial skills that we've learned in this course:</p>
      <ul class="reflection-list">
        <li><u>Leadership</u> - Many aerospace engineers work in small groups on specific tasks on a project. Leadership is essential in managing these small teams to get the most out of every individual. Leadership in this context includes giving all team members the correct roles, managing everyone's work to ensure deadlines are met, bringing all the parts together to create a final product, and overall managing the team to get work done efficiently.</li>
        <li><u>Organization</u> - Organization is vital in aerospace engineering since often in aerospace engineering we are working on many tasks at once with multiple different components that if not organized well can become overwhelming and messy. Organization means using a calendar to organize your time, having organization in the literal sense with all your designs and parts correctly categorized along with working with your team by organizing the overall project to seamlessly flow together.</li>
        <li><u>Analytical</u> - Analytical skills are vital in aerospace engineering as they provide engineers with the ability to analyse the many problems that occur with aircraft. Analytical skills are used when designing airframes to ensure they meet the specified criteria, analysing the different components of the aircraft and the different data to make the most reasonable decisions, and to correctly bring all the data together for effective execution of our plans.</li>
        <li><u>Project Management</u> - As I‚Äôve mentioned before, aerospace engineers often work in small teams on very specific parts of the overall project. Project management is vital to ensuring that the project flows smoothly with the team. Managing a project includes making sure that the task is clearly defined to members, having a clear and concise plan to accomplish the set goal, and tracking progress to ensure the plan is being executed.</li>
        <li><u>Technological Skills</u> - Apart from the practical technical skills needed to develop aircraft, it is important for engineers to be able to use and adapt to different softwares for all sorts of tasks such as design, testing, and team collaboration. It is also vital that engineers are able to use presentation softwares and online tools to represent their work to senior engineers.  Without these technical skills and familiarity with online software engineers may not be able to convey effectively their ideas and work.</li>
