      <p><strong>Tobias LÃ¼tke</strong> is the famous Canadian entrepreneur who founded Shopify, the online platform that helps ecommerce businesses run easy systems to operate and get their products to their customers effectivly. I chose Lutke as my entrepreneurial role model for many reasons: He is Canadian, he started his business at a young age (in college) and he was able to grow his platform into a billion dollar company with many of the values that I strive to aquire.</p>
      <br />
      <h4>Values:</h4>
      <p>Many of the values that I've chosen in my Vision & Mission tab align with Mr. Lutke's and are relatable in his style of management: Discipline in his relentlessness to succeed despite many telling him that his idea was not good, Innovation in his ability to think outside the box in the ecommerce world, and his ability to collaberate with an effective team (+ his two other co-founders) to increase their chances of success!</p>

      <h2 id="why-lutke-title">Why Tobias Lutke?</h2>
      <p>I chose Mr. Lutke in specific because of not only his Canadian origin, but because of my admiration for his ability to develop shopify into a global brand that has risen the ranks to become a very high valued company. Shopify embodies the vision and mission that I strive for in live: to contribute to society and be impactful. Shopify, under Lutke's leadership has revolutionized what it means to run a business, making it so much easier for people to get started online and leveling the playfield in terms of technology for smaller business owners. This is truly quite an impactful company and I hope to start a similar startup in the future that can have a similar scale of impact as Shopify does. </p>
