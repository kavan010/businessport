      <h1>My Mission, Vision, and SMART Goals</h1>
      <p>These are my personal life visions, missions, and goals that I will set to actualize them using the S.M.A.R.T goal-setting framework.</p>
      <br />

          <p><u>VISION:</u></p>
          <p>
            My personal vision in life is quite an important thing to descide as it determines the premise on which you commit your life mission, and thus the desitions you make in your life. My personal vision would likley be: <strong>“To live in the most impactful way to society, and contribute as much as possible to the progression of humanity“.</strong> This vision statement encompases two key elements: my devotion to contribute the most to society whether that be through work or through social impact, and the idea of the progression of humanity and contributing to making society a better place.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><u>MISSION:</u></p>
          <p>
            To complete this life vision statement, I have to set a mission statement that will help me take actionable steps to succeed. Although still unclear, I could craft together my personal mission statement to be: <strong>“To advance in the fields of technology and innovation, and start a startup that will allow me to allocate and manage resources effectivly to accomplish my goals (vision).”</strong> This mission statement is aligned with my vision as it focuses on creating impact through design and technology, which are key areas where I can contribute to society and humanity's progression.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><u>VALUES:</u></p>
          <p>
            Here I will list some of my personal values that I believe will positively guide my actions in persuing my vision and mission statements:
          </p>
          <ul class="values-list">
            <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> To always strive to do my very best no matter the circumstances</li>
            <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Embrace creativity and not think "inside the box", but question things</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Learning to work with others effectivly for common goals</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Always be honest and transparent in my actions</li>
            <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Continuously seek personal and professional development</li>

        </div>
      </div>
      <h2>Direction in Life:</h2>
      <div class="direction-flex">
        <div class="direction-text">
          <p>
            This vision and mission statement, along with the values I have listed aim to construct an image of the direction I wish to take in my life. Connecting the three, we can see a common theme of hard work and innovation, two key elements that I really want to maintain as my goal to start a startup is often linked with the two. My values see a consistant theme of entrepreneurial ideas such as collaberation and growth that are essential in business, and my vision statement is quite complementing to the goal of many business which is to not only create profit but to innovate and evolve the industry. This is how these three key elements relate to the direction I want to take in my life, and how they will help me achieve my goals.
