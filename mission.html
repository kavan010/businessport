      <h1>My Mission, Vision, and SMART Goals</h1>
      <p>These are my personal life visions, missions, and goals that I will set to actualize them using the S.M.A.R.T goal-setting framework.</p>

          <p><u>VISION:</u></p>
          <p>
            My personal vision in life is quite an important thing to decide as it determines the premise on which you commit your life mission, and thus the decisions you make in your life. My personal vision would likely be: <strong>“To live in the most impactful way to society, and contribute as much as possible to the progression of humanity“.</strong> This vision statement integrates two key elements: my devotion to contribute the most to society whether that be through work or through social impact, and the idea of the progression of humanity and contributing to making society a better place.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><u>MISSION:</u></p>
          <p>
            To complete this life vision statement, I have to set a mission statement that will help me take actionable steps to succeed. Although still unclear, I could craft together my personal mission statement to be: <strong>“To advance in the fields of technology and innovation, and start a startup that will allow me to allocate and manage resources effectively to accomplish my goals (vision).”</strong> This mission statement is aligned with my vision as it focuses on creating impact through design and technology, which are key areas where I can contribute to society and humanity's progression.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p><u>VALUES:</u></p>
          <p>
            Here I will list some of my personal values that I believe will positively guide my actions in pursuing my vision and mission statements:
          </p>
          <ul class="values-list">
            <li><strong>Discipline:</strong> To always strive to do my very best no matter the circumstances</li>
            <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Embrace creativity and not think "inside the box", but question things</li>
            <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Learning to work with others effectivly for common goals</li>
            <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Always be honest and transparent in my actions</li>
            <li><strong>Growth:</strong> Continuously seek personal and professional development</li>

        </div>
      </div>
      <h2>Direction in Life:</h2>
      <div class="direction-flex">
        <div class="direction-text">
          <p>
            This vision and mission statement, along with the values I have listed aim to construct an image of the direction I wish to take in my life. Connecting the three, we can see a common theme of hard work and innovation, two key elements that I really want to maintain as my goal to start a startup is often linked with the two. My values see a consistent theme of entrepreneurial ideas such as collaboration and growth that are essential in business, and my vision statement is quite complementing to the goal of many businesses which is to not only create profit but to innovate and evolve the industry. This is how these three key elements relate to the direction I want to take in my life, and how they will help me achieve my goals.

      <h2>SMART Goals</h2>
      <p>In this course I've set many goals as documented in my SMART goals organizer. In my SMART goals organizer I aimed to get an average of 95%+, which I've actually been able to complete as my forseen average is currently at a 96.25%.</p>
      <p>Additionally my goal that I'd tracked, to be able to preform 10 pullups by the end of 2025. Currently I am on track to compelte this goal as I've added 2-3 pullups in the last 3-4 months of the tracker. At this rate I should be able to complete the 10 pullups, and some additonal ones aswell if I continue at my training and workout.</p>
      <p>Here however, I want to set another goal. One that will assist me in my entrepreneurial journey and goal to start a startup: My SMART goal is to <strong>"Learn to fine tune AI language models, and create 3 AI apps by the end of summer 2025.</strong> </p>
      <ul class="smartgoals-list">
        <li><strong>Specific:</strong> "fine tune AI", a specific branch of AI focusing on editing already existing models</li>
        <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Is measurable in the 3 apps that I will make showcasing my skills </li>
        <li><strong>Achievable:</strong> Definitly achievable given my prior skill to learn this within 2 months</li>
        <li><strong>Relevant:</strong> Aligned with my interest, along with a useful skill when looking into the field of AI startups</li>
        <li><strong>Time-bound:</strong> Achieve this goal by the end of summer, September 2025.</li>
      </ul>
